# Guess-Who

### What is This App:
* A business oriented take on the children’s game Guess Who. It uses mock data right now but can be reformatted to take in form data for a company’s staff.
 
### Why Use This App: 
* The purpose of this application is to be used as a tool to help employees get to know their coworkers in their company. A great solution to not knowing your coworkers or being a new person joining a team or department. This tool would help break the ice and help people learn critical things about their peers that would create that initial introduction that can be very challenging.

### Todo:
* Refactor functions to follow the single responsability principle.
* CSS fixes
